# Pipe
Piper-like game for DOS I've made in mid 90s.

You have to create a pipeline as long as possible. As soon as you start building, the water starts flowing. The tiles you can build are displayed in the right (blue on will be placed next). Placing each tile costs 'money'. Each filled pipe segments yields money and score. Filling a crossroad both directions gives bonus score. The game ends if the water cannot flow any further (i.e. to a wrong tile or to an empty tile). Replacing a tile costs extra money.

Arrow keys - move

Enter - place tile

The game is turn-based. But every move of the cursor also counts as a turn.
